an automated test in javascript is code that throws an error when things are unexpected it is just code that throws an error when the result is not what is expected

an assertion library takes in a value that you want to test (usually derived from a function or some logic) and provides a set of assertion functions in return that you can use to apply different assertions to the derived value

a testing framework's job is to help devs identify what is broken and where it is broken as quickly as possible, and it can do that by making more helpful messages and by running all the tests in a file

you can use the --require flag when doing a node cli command to include global variables
in the file that you have put as required, just attach the global variables/functions to the global object

create our own test function to allow us to encapsulate our automated tests, isolate them from other tests in the file, and ensure we run all the tests in the file with more helpful error messages.
The assertion library will help our test assertions read more like a phrase you might say which will help people understand our intentions better. It will also help us avoid unnecessary duplication.
